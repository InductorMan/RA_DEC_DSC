# Encoder Library

Based on Paul Stoffregen's library, 
This library has been substantially altered to address an issue with ESP8266 performance and for index pin use (see source comments for documentation).

Text below and links below are his:

Encoder counts pulses from quadrature encoded signals, which are commonly available from rotary knobs, motor or shaft sensors and other position sensors.
